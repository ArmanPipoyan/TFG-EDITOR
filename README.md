# TFG- Aula de programaci√≥ interactiva

One of the biggest problems teachers face in programming is supervising students when it comes to making problems and developing code in class. These make it difficult to receive feedback directly, as there are no tools by which a teacher can help students in the class without exposing themselves or wasting time going table by table. Furthermore, this problem has been exacerbated due to the health crisis, as the need to have a tool to solve this problem. So, we decided to create an interactive programming, classroom where the teacher will be able to post problems and students will be able to solve them. The innovation in this project is that at all times the teacher can see in a list the code developed by students and access and modify them, thus providing real-time feedback from the comfort of your computer.

# What is this? <a name="1"></a>
Recognize the situations in which the application of computational learning algorithms can be useful to solve a problem.
can be useful to solve a problem.Analyze the problem to be solved and design the optimal solution by applying the techniques learnt. Write technical documents related to the analysis and solution of a problem. Program the basic algorithms to solve the proposed problems. Evaluate the results of the implemented solution and assess possible improvements and defend and argue the decisions taken in the solution of the proposed problems.

6. Write a sentence or a text
7. See predictions!


# Description <a name="2"></a>
 
  In order to make a good language prediction, we must first follow a series of steps to ensure that we do it correctly:
  - Load the data
  - Convert the dataset to lowercase
  - Verify that there are no null rows, if there are, remove them from the dataset.
  - Separate the dataset into training and test subsets.
  - Convert the training and test data into a sparse matrix with the CountVectorizer function.
  - Test different models

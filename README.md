# TFG- Aula de programaci√≥ interactiva

One of the biggest problems teachers face in programming is supervising students when it comes to making problems and developing code in class. These make it difficult to receive feedback directly, as there are no tools by which a teacher can help students in the class without exposing themselves or wasting time going table by table. Furthermore, this problem has been exacerbated due to the health crisis, as the need to have a tool to solve this problem. So, we decided to create an interactive programming, classroom where the teacher will be able to post problems and students will be able to solve them. The innovation in this project is that at all times the teacher can see in a list the code developed by students and access and modify them, thus providing real-time feedback from the comfort of your computer.
